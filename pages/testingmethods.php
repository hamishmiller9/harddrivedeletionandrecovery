            <h2>Testing Methodologies</h2>
            <p>A physical desktop environment was utilised for testing the Windows-based deletion methods, solely for the purpose of this project. The desktop system features standard components capable of running Windows 11 that replicate a standard user’s device, and therefore enhancing the replicability of this project and applicability of results obtained into real-world findings. 
The system configuration includes:
•	Processor: AMD A10-7580k Central Processing Unit (CPU)

•	Memory: 8 gigabytes (GB) of Random Access Memory (RAM)

•	Storage: 120 gigabytes (GB) Solid State Drive (SSD) for the operating system and software.
Whilst the testing was conducted on the referenced HDD, the SSD was included to separate the software being tested (for example, the operating system and the deletion tools) from the data on the HDD being retrieved. This mitigated the risk of any confusion and ensured the focus remained solely on testing the files on the HDD.
