            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of various common data deletion techniques in ensuring the irretrievable removal of data from Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), with the goal of providing actionable insights for improving data privacy practices. It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most prevalent data deletion techniques, analysing their reliability and susceptibility to forensic recovery. Given the importance of data security for both personal and professional users, this study will critically evaluate the following commonly used data deletion methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>File deletion using built-in Microsoft Windows 11 system tools</li>
                <li>Secure deletion with specalised software (Eraser, File Shredder, WipeFile)</li>
                <li>Low-Level Formatting</li>
                <li>Physical destruction</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is secure deletion?</h3>
            <p>Secure data deletion is a critical process in maintaining data security and privacy in both personal and professional environments. Yet, many individuals have a limited understanding of how permanent data deletion is achieved. The Cambridge Dictionary defines ‘delete’ in an Information Technology (IT) context as “to remove data, documents, programs, etc. from a computer”. A common assumption is that data deleted from a computer, regardless of the method used, results in permanent removal. In truth, standard deletion methods, such as using the Recycle Bin in Windows 11, prioritise speed and convenience over security. These methods only remove the file reference, leaving the actual data recoverable until overwritten. This misunderstanding can potentially result in unintended data exposure, especially when storage devices are sold, discarded, or repurposed without adequate sanitisation.</p>
